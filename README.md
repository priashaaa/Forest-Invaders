Wizards and Goblins: The Ultimate Battle

Game Overview:
Step into the mystical realm of Wizards and Goblins, a thrilling and dynamic automated animation of gameplay inspired by the classic Space Invaders. In this enchanting world, wizards and goblins vie for supremacy on a constantly shifting battlefield. Players will witness an epic clash of magic and might as wizards unleash powerful spells and goblins employ their brute strength and cunning tactics.

Gameplay Mechanics:

    Entities:
        Wizards: Wise and powerful, wizards are masters of the arcane arts. They possess high intelligence and can cast devastating spells. Each wizard is unique, with a range of magical abilities that can turn the tide of battle in an instant.
        Goblins: Fierce and relentless, goblins are driven by their insatiable hunger for victory. They rely on sheer numbers and savage attacks to overwhelm their enemies. Despite their smaller stature, goblins are swift and can quickly swarm their foes.

    Combat System:
        The game features a real-time combat system where wizards and goblins move autonomously, guided by advanced AI behaviors. Each entity has health points (HP) and attack cooldowns, making timing and positioning crucial.
        Wizards: Wizards cast spells at a distance, dealing damage and occasionally applying status effects. They have a cooldown period after each spell, requiring strategic use of their abilities.
        Goblins: Goblins charge at their enemies with ferocious melee attacks. They can attack multiple times in quick succession, but must close the distance to be effective.
